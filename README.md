# Idea
I would like to create a CLI tool for file versioning, something like "Git".
<hr>

# Licence
The project is based on the MIT license so if you are welcomed, you can easily use and be inspired by my way of software development.
<hr>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The FileFlow project is being developed in my spare time, so it is possible that it will not be updated often due to other projects I am working on
<hr>

# Education
The project is being created for educational purposes, to explore how such a system works and what problems developers have to deal with when developing such software.<br><br>

My goal is to learn how the version control system works (backend) and create functional tool that will be fully working
<hr>

# Requirements
All you need to run this tool is installed <strong>.NET 8</strong>
<hr>

# How to run
For now the simpliest way to run the tool:
- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lewan24/FileFlow.git
```
- Go inside the repo directory and navigate to: <strong>"src -> FileFlow.Cli"</strong>
- Then run command:
```bash
dotnet run -- [Tool commands]
```
The <strong>[Tool commands]</strong> is actually the commands of the cli tool that you can use. This is how you can run help command:
```bash
dotnet run -- -h
```
